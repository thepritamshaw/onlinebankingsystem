**How to Run the Project (Development Setup)**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system. You can refer to the official documentation for installation instructions:
        * Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thepritamshaw/onlinebankingsystem.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd onlinebankingsystem
    ```

4. **Install project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6. **Access the Online Banking System:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or your local server address if different). You should now be able to access the online banking system and start using its features.

**Note:** This is a basic setup for development purposes. In a production environment, we would need to configure a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to serve the application and implement additional security measures.
